/*
1. You are given a number n, representing the count of coins.
2. You are given n numbers, representing the denominations of n coins.
3. You are given a number "amt".
4. You are required to calculate and print the combinations of the n coins (non-duplicate) using 
     which the amount "amt" can be paid.

Note -> Use the code snippet and follow the algorithm discussed in question video. The judge can't 
               force you but the intention is to teach a concept. Play in spirit of the question.
